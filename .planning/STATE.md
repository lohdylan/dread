## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Fabric over Forge: Modern, lightweight, 1.21.x support (Pending)
- Single entity focus: Nail the horror before expanding (Pending)
- 300 second revive window: Long enough for friends to reach, short enough for tension (Pending)
- Spectator mode for perm death: Player can still watch friends, stays in session (Pending)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 2 Planning:**
- Turn-around jump scare mechanics require FOV calculations and precise positioning — research suggests complexity
- Sound priority management needed to prevent channel exhaustion during layered audio

**Phase 3 Planning:**
- Death event ordering has edge cases with Totem of Undying and other death-modifying mods
- Camera control for cinematic requires network synchronization across client-server

**General:**
- Minecraft 1.21.11 is last Yarn-mapped version — plan migration to Mojang Mappings for future updates
