# Milestone v1.1: Polish & Immersion

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-26
**Phases:** 5-8
**Total Plans:** 10

## Overview

Replace placeholder assets and enhance downed state immersion to deliver genuinely terrifying horror experience.

## Phases

### Phase 5: Resources

**Goal**: Dread entity has terrifying appearance and horror audio that replaces placeholders
**Depends on**: v1.0 foundation
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01: Create horror textures for all 3 Dread form variants with glowmasks
- [x] 05-02: Create horror audio with variations for 3-layer soundscape
- [x] 05-03: Update sounds.json with new audio file references and weights

**Details:**
- 6 PNG texture files (3 forms + 3 glowmasks)
- 11 OGG audio files for ambient, proximity, jump scare, death sounds
- Replaced 5 silent placeholder audio files
- All textures visible with glowmask rendering via AutoGlowingGeoLayer

### Phase 6: Attack Prevention

**Goal**: Players cannot attack while in downed state
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 06-01: Server-side attack callbacks + client-side animation mixin

**Details:**
- AttackEntityCallback blocks melee attacks
- UseItemCallback blocks projectile weapons (bow, crossbow, trident)
- ClientAttackMixin prevents arm swing animation
- Dual blocking for authoritative server + smooth client UX

### Phase 7: Crawl Pose

**Goal**: Downed players visually crawl with synchronized animations
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 07-01: Core pose override (server-side pose management + client-side mixin)
- [x] 07-02: Movement restrictions (no jump, no sprint, no interactions)
- [x] 07-03: Visual effects (blood vignette, particles, camera pitch limiting)

**Details:**
- EntityPose.SWIMMING for prone/crawling pose
- Server sets pose, client mixin prevents vanilla reset
- Blood vignette overlay with red tint
- DRIPPING_LAVA particles for blood effect
- Camera pitch limited to -30 degrees

### Phase 8: Cinematic Enhancement

**Goal**: Death cinematic delivers intense, terrifying experience with extended grab and camera effects
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 08-01: Extended death grab animation with GeckoLib sound keyframes
- [x] 08-02: Camera shake system with exponential decay and config option
- [x] 08-03: Compensation effects, FPS auto-reduction, and cinematic integration

**Details:**
- 1.8s death_grab animation (vs 0.8s original attack)
- Front-loaded violence timing: 0.15s lunge, 0.85s hold, 0.8s release
- Camera shake with MAGNITUDE 2.5f, DECAY_SPEED 8.0f
- cameraShakeIntensity config (0-100, default 100)
- FPS-based auto-reduction below 45 FPS
- Visual compensation when shake reduced

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Phase 5 first: Zero-code asset replacement enables early visual/audio wins
- EntityPose.SWIMMING for crawl: Vanilla provides animation, no custom needed
- Dual blocking pattern: Server authoritative + client UX
- FPS threshold 45: Below this, shake causes judder
- Compensation formula: When reducing shake, boost vignette/flash

**Issues Resolved:**
- Replaced 5 silent placeholder audio files with real horror sounds
- Fixed mixin target for PlayerSprintMixin (Entity vs PlayerEntity)
- Fixed GeckoLib AutoPlayingSoundKeyframeHandler import path

**Issues Deferred:**
- grab_impact.ogg audio file (sound event registered but file missing)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Missing grab_impact.ogg for death grab animation sound keyframe
