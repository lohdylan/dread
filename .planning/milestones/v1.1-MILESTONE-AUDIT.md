## Cross-Phase Integration

**Total Integrations Verified:** 41

### Key Integration Points

| From | To | Via | Status |
|------|-----|-----|--------|
| Phase 8 | Phase 7 | DeathCinematicClientHandler → CrawlPoseHandler | WIRED |
| Phase 8 | Phase 5 | GRAB_IMPACT sound event → audio file | MISSING |
| Phase 7 | Phase 6 | Both use DownedStateClientHandler | WIRED |
| Phase 6 | Phase 3 | AttackPreventionHandler → DownedPlayersState | WIRED |

### Shared Dependencies

| Dependency | Consumers | Status |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| DownedStateClientHandler.isDownedEffectActive() | 7 files (Phase 6, 7, 8) | VERIFIED |
| DownedPlayersState.isDowned() | 7 files (Phase 6, 7) | VERIFIED |
| CrawlPoseHandler | 3 call sites | VERIFIED |

## Tech Debt

### Phase 8: Missing GRAB_IMPACT Audio

**Issue:** The death grab animation has a sound keyframe at 0.0s referencing "dread:grab_impact", but the audio file doesn't exist.

**Current State:**
- Sound event registered: `ModSounds.GRAB_IMPACT` ✓
- Animation keyframe: `dread_entity.animation.json:690` references "dread:grab_impact" ✓
- sounds.json entry: MISSING
- Audio file: `grab_impact.ogg` MISSING

**Impact:** Death grab animation plays silently at the moment of impact. Experience degraded but not broken.

**Fix Required:**
1. Create `src/main/resources/assets/dread/sounds/grab_impact.ogg` (mono, 44.1kHz)
2. Add to sounds.json:
```json
"grab_impact": {
  "category": "hostile",
  "sounds": [{ "name": "dread:grab_impact", "stream": false }]
}
```

**Severity:** LOW - Non-blocking, affects polish only

## Anti-Patterns

None found across all v1.1 phases. No TODO comments, placeholder implementations, or stubs detected.

## Initialization Order

**Server (DreadMod.java):** Correct order - foundations before dependents
**Client (DreadClient.java):** Correct order - handlers before renderers
**Mixins (dread.mixins.json):** All 7 v1.1 mixins registered (3 server, 4 client)

## Recommendation

**Status: READY FOR RELEASE** with noted tech debt.

All 12 requirements satisfied. All 3 E2E flows complete. One minor audio gap that affects polish but not functionality.

Options:
1. **Complete milestone now** - Accept tech debt, track grab_impact.ogg in backlog
2. **Quick fix first** - Add grab_impact.ogg before completing (estimated: single audio file)
