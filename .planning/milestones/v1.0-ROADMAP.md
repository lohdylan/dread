# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-25
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 20

## Overview

Dread is a Minecraft horror mod delivering genuine terror through a cosmic horror entity with turn-around jump scares, cinematic death sequences, and cooperative revival mechanics. This roadmap structured delivery across four phases: foundational entity creation, AI-driven stalking and sound design, death/revival systems, and configuration polish for release.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Entity

**Goal**: Dread entity exists as a visible, animated horror creature with proper Fabric mod infrastructure
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: ENTITY-01, ENTITY-02, ENTITY-03, ENTITY-04
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Fabric mod skeleton with entity registration
- [x] 01-02: GeckoLib model, textures, and renderer
- [x] 01-03: Entity behaviors (torch extinguishing, form variants)
- [x] 01-04: Human visual verification checkpoint

**Details:**
- Complete Dread entity with Cthulhu-style cosmic horror appearance
- GeckoLib animations (idle with twitching, jerky walk, attack, spawn/despawn)
- Emissive eyes and tentacle tips that glow in darkness
- Torch extinguishing within 8 blocks (one by one with smoke particles)
- Three visual variants (BASE, EVOLVED, ELDRITCH) based on world day progression
- NBT persistence for form variants across world saves

**Completed:** 2026-01-24

### Phase 2: AI & Horror Experience

**Goal**: Dread intelligently stalks players with turn-around jump scares and full atmospheric soundscape
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: AI-01, AI-02, AI-03, AI-04, SOUND-01, SOUND-02, SOUND-04
**Plans**: 6 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Sound event registration and placeholder audio files
- [x] 02-02: Spawn probability system with persistent state
- [x] 02-03: AI goals (turn-around spawn, stare-to-freeze, vanish)
- [x] 02-04: Fake-out behaviors with varied tension sounds
- [x] 02-05: Proximity audio and ambient tension integration
- [x] 02-06: Human verification checkpoint

**Details:**
- Turn-around spawn mechanic (entity appears 3-8 blocks behind player)
- Weeping Angel / SCP-173 stare mechanic (entity freezes when watched, vanishes after 30s)
- Mining-based spawn probability (increments danger with each block broken)
- Day-based escalation (1x to 11x multiplier, capped at day 20)
- Fake-out system (3:1 ratio of false alarms to real spawns)
- Priority-based sound system (jumpscare > proximity > ambient)
- Dynamic audio atmosphere (ambient tension, proximity triggers, unnatural silence)

**Completed:** 2026-01-24

### Phase 3: Death & Revival System

**Goal**: Players experience unskippable cinematic death followed by downed state with cooperative revival mechanics
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: DEATH-01, DEATH-02, DEATH-03, DEATH-04, SOUND-03
**Plans**: 6 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Satin API dependency, death sound, network packets
- [x] 03-02: DownedPlayersState server-side persistence
- [x] 03-03: Death event interception and cinematic controller
- [x] 03-04: Downed state shaders and HUD timer
- [x] 03-05: Revival mechanics and spectator transition
- [x] 03-06: Human verification checkpoint

**Details:**
- Death event interception via Fabric ALLOW_DEATH event
- 4.5-second cinematic camera lock onto Dread face-to-face
- Gaussian blur + vignette shader for near-blind downed vision
- HUD countdown timer with yellow-to-red color interpolation
- 300-second downed timer with spectator transition on expiration
- Crouch-to-revive within 4 blocks (3-second uninterruptible)
- World-space billboard progress bar above downed player
- 90% movement speed reduction during downed state

**Completed:** 2026-01-24

### Phase 4: Configuration & Release Prep

**Goal**: Players can customize mod behavior and mod is release-ready with full documentation
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: CONFIG-01, CONFIG-02, CONFIG-03, CONFIG-04
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: GSON config system with validation (DreadConfig, DreadConfigLoader)
- [x] 04-02: Config integration into spawn, damage, and cinematic systems
- [x] 04-03: Shader compatibility detection (Iris/OptiFine) with fallback
- [x] 04-04: Human verification checkpoint

**Details:**
- GSON-based config system with 7 configurable fields (spawn rates, damage, feature toggles)
- Config validation with automatic clamping to safe ranges
- Master mod toggle (modEnabled) across spawn, death, and damage systems
- Runtime shader mod detection (Iris/OptiFine) with graceful post-processing fallback
- Config override for manual shader effect disabling (disableDownedEffects)
- Death cinematic skip option (skipDeathCinematic) preserving audio feedback

**Completed:** 2026-01-25

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**
- None (all phases were integer phases)

**Key Decisions:**
- Fabric over Forge: Modern, lightweight, 1.21.x support
- Single entity focus: Nail the horror before expanding
- 300 second revive window: Long enough for friends to reach, short enough for tension
- Spectator mode for perm death: Player can still watch friends, stays in session
- Sound registration before entities: Ensures sounds available when entities spawn
- Base spawn chance 0.5% per second: Provides 10-20% chance per minute baseline
- Day escalation capped at day 20: Prevents infinite scaling, 11x multiplier max
- 3:1 fake-out to real spawn ratio: Maintains psychological horror unpredictability
- Satin API for post-processing: org.ladysnake:satin:1.17.0 for shader effects
- GSON with pretty printing: Human-readable config files

**Issues Resolved:**
- Death event ordering handled via Fabric ALLOW_DEATH with health preservation
- Shader compatibility via runtime detection with graceful fallback
- Network packet serialization for multiplayer via custom UUID PacketCodec

**Issues Deferred:**
- Placeholder audio files need real horror audio assets
- Multiplayer testing on dedicated server (structural code complete)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Placeholder textures (functional but need proper art assets)
- 5 placeholder OGG audio files (triggers verified, need audio drop-in)
