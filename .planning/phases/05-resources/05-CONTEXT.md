# Phase 5: Resources - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-25
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Replace placeholder textures and audio with horror-appropriate assets. Dread entity gets terrifying cosmic horror appearance with emissive glowmask. Audio system gets organic horror soundscape with ambient drone, proximity intensification, and jump scare sounds. All 3 form variants (BASE, EVOLVED, ELDRITCH) get visually distinct textures.

## Implementation Decisions

### Entity Appearance
- Humanoid frame but twisted — vaguely human proportions with unnatural joints and limbs
- Tentacles evolve with form: back/shoulders (BASE), replacing limbs (EVOLVED), emerging from torso (ELDRITCH)
- Skin surface: cracked and veiny — dry, fissured skin with pulsing veins underneath
- Color palette: deep purple body with angry red/magenta veins pulsing through the cracks
- Face: distorted human face with stretched jaw — mouth open too wide, jaw unhinged, silent scream
- Asymmetrical design — one side more corrupted, feels organic and wrong
- Horror reference: Lovecraftian cosmic horror — unknowable, ancient, reality-bending wrongness

### Glowmask Design
- Glow areas: eyes + veins — eyes pierce through darkness, veins pulse with inner light
- Glow color: same red as veins — angry, pulsing red like something alive and hot inside
- Glow intensity: subtle — just visible in darkness, you see it when it's too late
- Glow intensity escalates with form: BASE barely glows, ELDRITCH burns bright

### Form Variants
- Clear escalation between forms — players can obviously recognize which form they're facing
- Tentacle progression:
  - BASE: tentacles from back/shoulders
  - EVOLVED: tentacles replacing limbs (hands/feet become tentacle clusters)
  - ELDRITCH: tentacles emerging from torso core + all previous
- ELDRITCH: just more of everything — more tentacles, more veins, more glow, quantity over new elements

### Audio Atmosphere
- Sound character: organic/biological — wet, breathing, pulsing, like something alive and wrong
- Ambient drone: wet organic hum — like being inside something alive, squelching and pulsing ambience
- Jump scare: sudden scream/shriek — sharp, piercing, pure terror
- Proximity intensification: pitch/distortion — sounds warp and distort more as distance closes, reality breaking

### Claude's Discretion
- Glow behavior (pulse vs constant vs flicker)
- Color progression between forms (same palette intensified vs shift toward darker)
- Exact spacing of corruption/asymmetry
- Specific distortion parameters for proximity audio

## Specific Ideas

- "Creepy, tentacles, purple and veins, just gross and creepy"
- Lovecraftian cosmic horror as the reference point
- Stretched jaw face like a silent scream — deeply unsettling

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope
