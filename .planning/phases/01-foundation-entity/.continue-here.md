<current_state>
Project initialization complete. Ready to plan Phase 1: Foundation & Entity.

We just finished:
- Deep questioning to understand the horror mod concept
- Research across 4 dimensions (stack, features, architecture, pitfalls)
- Requirements definition (20 v1 requirements across 5 categories)
- Roadmap creation (4 phases)

No code written yet. Phase 1 planning has not started.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Project initialization: Complete
- .planning/PROJECT.md: Dread horror mod concept documented
- .planning/config.json: YOLO mode, quick depth, parallel execution, all workflow agents enabled
- .planning/research/: Stack, Features, Architecture, Pitfalls, Summary researched
- .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md: 20 v1 requirements defined with REQ-IDs
- .planning/ROADMAP.md: 4 phases mapped to all requirements
- .planning/STATE.md: Project state initialized
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Phase 1: Foundation & Entity (not planned)
  - ENTITY-01: Dread entity with Cthulhu design
  - ENTITY-02: GeckoLib animations
  - ENTITY-03: Light extinguishing
  - ENTITY-04: Multiple forms
- Phase 2: AI & Horror Experience (not planned)
- Phase 3: Death & Revival System (not planned)
- Phase 4: Configuration & Release Prep (not planned)
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Fabric 1.21.x over Forge: Modern, lightweight, good 1.21 support
- GeckoLib for animations: Vanilla lacks concurrent animations needed for horror
- Cardinal Components API for state sync: Required for multiplayer downed/revive mechanics
- Quick depth (4 phases): Faster iteration, ship sooner
- YOLO mode: Auto-approve execution, minimal interruptions
- All workflow agents enabled: Research, plan check, and verifier for quality
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None - ready to proceed with Phase 1 planning.
</blockers>

<context>
This is a Minecraft horror mod called "Dread" featuring:
- Cthulhu-style cosmic horror entity
- Turn-around jump scare mechanic (appears when player looks away then back)
- Mining activity and day-based spawn escalation
- Unskippable cinematic death sequence
- 300 second downed state with multiplayer revive
- Permanent death to spectator mode

The core value is: "The jump scare must be genuinely terrifying."

Research identified key risks:
- Turn-around spawn is HIGH complexity (FOV raycasting, positioning)
- Client-server desync is common Fabric pitfall
- Sound channel limits (247 max) could affect layered audio
- Entity memory leaks if not properly cleaned up

<next_action>
Run `/gsd:discuss-phase 1` to gather context before planning, or `/gsd:plan-phase 1` to plan directly.

Phase 1 delivers: Dread entity with Cthulhu design, GeckoLib animations, light extinguishing, and multiple forms.
