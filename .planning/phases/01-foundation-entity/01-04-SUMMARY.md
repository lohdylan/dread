# Plan 01-04: Human Visual Verification — Summary

**Status:** Complete
**Duration:** Human checkpoint
**Completed:** 2026-01-24

## Outcome

**APPROVED** — Human verified the Dread entity meets horror standards.

## What Was Verified

1. **Entity Appearance**: Cthulhu-style cosmic horror aesthetic approved
2. **Animations**: Idle twitching, jerky walk, spawn/despawn effects confirmed creepy
3. **Torch Extinguishing**: One-by-one with smoke particles creates appropriate atmosphere
4. **Form Variants**: Three variants visually distinct with progressive horror intensity
5. **Persistence**: Entity and variant data persists across world saves

## Human Feedback

Approved without issues noted.

## Notes for Future Phases

- Placeholder textures are functional but should be replaced with proper art assets
- Animation timing may need fine-tuning after sound integration (Phase 2)
- Torch extinguishing range (8 blocks) approved as balanced
