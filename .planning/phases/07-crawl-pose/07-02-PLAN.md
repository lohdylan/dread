<objective>
Implement movement restrictions for downed players: no jumping, no sprinting, and no block interactions.

Purpose: Downed players should feel helpless and vulnerable. Blocking these actions reinforces the "I need rescue" feeling and prevents exploits.

Output: Three server-side mixins that block jump, sprint, and interactions when player is in downed state.

  <name>Task 1: Create PlayerJumpMixin to block jumping</name>
  <files>src/main/java/com/dread/mixin/PlayerJumpMixin.java</files>
  <action>
Create server-side mixin to block jumping when downed.

**PlayerJumpMixin.java** in `src/main/java/com/dread/mixin/PlayerJumpMixin.java`:

```java
package com.dread.mixin;

import com.dread.death.DownedPlayersState;
import net.minecraft.entity.LivingEntity;
import net.minecraft.server.network.ServerPlayerEntity;
import org.spongepowered.asm.mixin.Mixin;
import org.spongepowered.asm.mixin.injection.At;
import org.spongepowered.asm.mixin.injection.Inject;
import org.spongepowered.asm.mixin.injection.callback.CallbackInfo;

/**
 * Server-side mixin that prevents jumping when player is downed.
 * Reinforces the helpless crawling state.
 */
@Mixin(LivingEntity.class)
public class PlayerJumpMixin {

    @Inject(method = "jump", at = @At("HEAD"), cancellable = true)
    private void dread$preventJumpWhenDowned(CallbackInfo ci) {
        if ((Object)this instanceof ServerPlayerEntity player) {
            DownedPlayersState state = DownedPlayersState.getOrCreate(player.getServerWorld());
            if (state.isDowned(player)) {
                ci.cancel();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Key points:
- Targets LivingEntity.jump() which is the actual jump execution
- Uses instanceof pattern to check if this is a ServerPlayerEntity
- Checks server-side downed state via DownedPlayersState
- Cancels jump at HEAD before any jump logic executes
  </action>
  <verify>Build succeeds, mixin applies without error</verify>
  <done>PlayerJumpMixin.java exists and blocks jumping for downed players</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create PlayerSprintMixin to block sprinting</name>
  <files>src/main/java/com/dread/mixin/PlayerSprintMixin.java</files>
  <action>
Create server-side mixin to block sprinting when downed.

**PlayerSprintMixin.java** in `src/main/java/com/dread/mixin/PlayerSprintMixin.java`:

```java
package com.dread.mixin;

import com.dread.death.DownedPlayersState;
import net.minecraft.entity.player.PlayerEntity;
import net.minecraft.server.network.ServerPlayerEntity;
import org.spongepowered.asm.mixin.Mixin;
import org.spongepowered.asm.mixin.injection.At;
import org.spongepowered.asm.mixin.injection.Inject;
import org.spongepowered.asm.mixin.injection.callback.CallbackInfo;

/**
 * Server-side mixin that prevents sprinting when player is downed.
 * Cancels at the input setter level to prevent input ghosting on revival.
 */
@Mixin(PlayerEntity.class)
public class PlayerSprintMixin {

    @Inject(method = "setSprinting", at = @At("HEAD"), cancellable = true)
    private void dread$preventSprintWhenDowned(boolean sprinting, CallbackInfo ci) {
        // Only block when trying to START sprinting, allow turning it off
        if (!sprinting) return;

        if ((Object)this instanceof ServerPlayerEntity player) {
            DownedPlayersState state = DownedPlayersState.getOrCreate(player.getServerWorld());
            if (state.isDowned(player)) {
                ci.cancel();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Key points:
- Targets setSprinting() at the input level, not execution
- Only blocks when sprinting=true (starting sprint)
- Allows sprinting=false to pass through (stopping sprint)
- Prevents "input ghosting" where buffered sprint triggers on revival
  </action>
  <verify>Build succeeds, mixin applies without error</verify>
  <done>PlayerSprintMixin.java exists and blocks sprinting for downed players</done>

  <name>Task 3: Create PlayerInteractionMixin to block interactions and register all mixins</name>
  <files>

src/main/resources/dread.mixins.json
  </files>
  <action>
Create server-side mixin to block block interactions (doors, buttons, chests, levers, etc.).

**PlayerInteractionMixin.java** in `src/main/java/com/dread/mixin/PlayerInteractionMixin.java`:

```java
package com.dread.mixin;

import net.minecraft.server.world.ServerWorld;

import org.spongepowered.asm.mixin.injection.callback.CallbackInfoReturnable;

/**

 * Prevents opening chests, using buttons, levers, doors, crafting tables, etc.
 */
@Mixin(ServerPlayerInteractionManager.class)
public class PlayerInteractionMixin {

    @Shadow
    protected ServerPlayerEntity player;

    @Inject(method = "interactBlock", at = @At("HEAD"), cancellable = true)
    private void dread$blockInteractionsWhenDowned(
        ServerPlayerEntity player,
        ServerWorld world,
        ItemStack stack,
        Hand hand,
        BlockHitResult hitResult,
        CallbackInfoReturnable<ActionResult> cir
    ) {
        DownedPlayersState state = DownedPlayersState.getOrCreate(world);
        if (state.isDowned(player)) {
            cir.setReturnValue(ActionResult.FAIL);
        }
    }
}
```

**Update dread.mixins.json** - Add all three server-side mixins to the "mixins" array:

```json
{
  "required": true,
  "minVersion": "0.8",
  "package": "com.dread.mixin",
  "compatibilityLevel": "JAVA_21",
  "mixins": [
    "PlayerJumpMixin",
    "PlayerSprintMixin",
    "PlayerInteractionMixin"
  ],
  "client": [
    "DeathScreenMixin",
    "ClientAttackMixin",
    "PlayerPoseMixin"
  ],
  "injectors": {
    "defaultRequire": 1
  }
}
```

Key points:
- Targets ServerPlayerInteractionManager.interactBlock()
- This is the server-side entry point for all block interactions
- Returns ActionResult.FAIL to silently deny the interaction
- Server-side mixins go in "mixins" array, client mixins in "client" array
  </action>
  <verify>
Build succeeds. Test in-game:
1. Get downed by Dread entity
2. Try to jump - should not work
3. Try to sprint - should not work
4. Try to open chest/door/use button - should not work
5. Get revived - all actions should work again
  </verify>
  <done>All three movement restriction mixins created and registered in dread.mixins.json</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After all tasks complete:

1. **Build verification:**
   - `./gradlew build` succeeds with no errors
   - No mixin application errors in log

2. **Single-player test:**
   - Spawn Dread entity, let it kill you
   - Try pressing space to jump - player should not jump
   - Try double-tap W or hold Ctrl to sprint - player should not sprint
   - Try right-clicking on door/chest/button - nothing should happen
   - Get revived by crouching friend
   - All three actions should work normally again
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- PlayerJumpMixin.java exists and blocks jumping for downed players
- PlayerSprintMixin.java exists and blocks sprinting for downed players
- PlayerInteractionMixin.java exists and blocks block interactions for downed players
- All three mixins registered in dread.mixins.json under "mixins" array
- Movement restrictions apply immediately when downed
- Movement restrictions lift immediately when revived
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/07-crawl-pose/07-02-SUMMARY.md`
