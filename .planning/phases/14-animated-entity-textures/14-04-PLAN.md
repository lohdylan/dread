<objective>
Verify animated texture system works correctly through in-game testing.

Purpose: Confirm that all Phase 14 success criteria are met - texture changes are visible, timing is correct, and performance is acceptable.

Output: Verification that phase requirements TEX-01 through TEX-05 are satisfied.

  <what-built>
Animated texture system for Dread entity with:
- Texture swapping during death sequence (pulse textures during pull-back, eyes_open during face close-up)
- Accelerating rune pulse timing (heartbeat rhythm from slow to fast)
- Tentacle writhing animation (subtle idle motion)
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. **Spawn Dread and observe idle state:**
   - Command: `/summon dread:dread_entity`
   - Watch for subtle tentacle movement (barely perceptible undulation)
   - Texture should be base texture with dim rune glow

2. **Trigger death sequence:**
   - Walk close enough to trigger Dread's attack
   - Or use debug command if available

3. **Observe death cinematic (4.5 seconds):**
   - **Pull-back phase (0-1.5s):** Watch for rune pulse changes
     - Texture should cycle through pulse_0, pulse_1, pulse_2
     - Pulse should accelerate (slow at start, rapid at end)
   - **Face close-up phase (1.5-4.5s):** Watch for eye reveal
     - At camera zoom to face, texture should switch to eyes_open
     - This should be instant (one frame transition)

4. **Check performance:**
   - Press F3 to show debug screen
   - Note FPS during cinematic
   - Should maintain 60+ FPS (no performance collapse)

5. **Verify requirements:**
   - TEX-01: Texture changes during sequence (not static) - PASS if textures cycle
   - TEX-02: Sync with cinematic timing - PASS if pulse matches pull-back phase
   - TEX-03: Emissive runes pulse - PASS if glowmask visible during pulse
   - TEX-04: Form writhing - PASS if tentacles move subtly during idle
   - TEX-05: 60+ FPS maintained - PASS if no FPS drops

Note: Placeholder textures may look identical (all copies of base), but texture SWAPPING should still occur. Full visual differentiation requires proper texture art (out of scope for code plans).

<success_criteria>
Phase 14 success criteria from ROADMAP.md:
1. Dread's texture changes during death sequence (not static throughout)
2. Emissive runes pulse visibly during kill (otherworldly glow synchronized to cinematic progress)
3. Dread's form shows writhing effects (tentacles shift, geometry distorts)
4. Eyes open as camera zooms to face (reveal timed to climax)
5. Texture animations run at 60+ FPS with AMD GPUs (no performance collapse)

All must be verified through in-game testing.
</success_criteria>
