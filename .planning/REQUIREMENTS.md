# Requirements: Dread

**Defined:** 2026-01-23
**Core Value:** The jump scare must be genuinely terrifying — entity appearance, cinematic kill, and audio must combine to deliver real horror.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Entity

- [ ] **ENTITY-01**: Dread entity with Cthulhu-style cosmic horror design
- [ ] **ENTITY-02**: GeckoLib animations for smooth, creepy movement
- [ ] **ENTITY-03**: Light extinguishing (Dread puts out nearby torches when spawning)
- [ ] **ENTITY-04**: Multiple Dread forms/appearances

### AI & Spawning

- [ ] **AI-01**: Turn-around spawn mechanic (appears when player looks away then back)
- [ ] **AI-02**: Mining activity increases spawn chance
- [ ] **AI-03**: Spawn probability escalates with game days
- [ ] **AI-04**: Fake-out behaviors (sometimes plays tension without attacking)

### Sound

- [ ] **SOUND-01**: Ambient tension soundscape
- [ ] **SOUND-02**: Jump scare audio when Dread appears
- [ ] **SOUND-03**: Death sequence audio
- [ ] **SOUND-04**: Sound intensity based on Dread proximity

### Death System

- [ ] **DEATH-01**: Unskippable cinematic death sequence
- [ ] **DEATH-02**: Downed state (300 seconds, blurred/dark screen)
- [ ] **DEATH-03**: Permanent death to spectator mode if not revived
- [ ] **DEATH-04**: Revive mechanic (friend crouches near downed player)

### Configuration

- [ ] **CONFIG-01**: Spawn rate configuration
- [ ] **CONFIG-02**: Damage settings
- [ ] **CONFIG-03**: Enable/disable mod toggle
- [ ] **CONFIG-04**: Option to skip death cinematic

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Environmental

- **ENV-01**: ARG elements (signs with ominous messages, changed paintings)
- **ENV-02**: Base-centric spawning (entity "knows where you live")
- **ENV-03**: Environmental manipulation (building structures, breaking blocks beyond lights)

### Audio Expansion

- **AUDIO-01**: Biome-specific horror sounds
- **AUDIO-02**: Dynamic music system

### Multiplayer Expansion

- **MP-01**: Entity targeting multiple players simultaneously
- **MP-02**: Shared fear/sanity mechanics

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Sanity/hallucination system | High complexity, not core to Dread's jump scare focus |
| Real-time chat integration | Out of scope for horror mod |
| Mobile/Bedrock support | Fabric Java Edition only |
| Mod compatibility layer | Focus on standalone experience first |
